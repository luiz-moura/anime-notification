The system imports the animes, genres, images, etc. from the current season via an API and persists in the database, the user can register and choose which animes they want to be notified when new episodes are broadcast by push notification.

The DDD architecture was implemented based on the article written by Brent on October 17, 2019 - [Domain-oriented Laravel](https://stitcher.io/blog/laravel-beyond-crud-01-domain-oriented-laravel) . The following patterns were also used: repository pattern, actions and use cases, data transfer objects.
